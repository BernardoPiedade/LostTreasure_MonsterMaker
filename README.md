Lost Treasure is a ttrpg that I'm writing.
This program serves as a fast way to create one or more monsters and save them in a excel file for easy access.

Once you add the monster level, all the other stats will be set depending on it. But still make sure to check in the end if everything looks ok.
This is only to speed up things, you still need to adjust it.
